# Description: REST API to keep track of notes for people who may visit you throughout the year. 
I did this project to learn more about Flask and REST APIs. 
- A Flask app with REST API. 
- Uses connexion to handle HTTP request.
- Documentation using Swagger UI.
- REST API is connected to a SQLite database.
- Uses SQLAIchemy to save Python objects to the database.
- Serialized data for the REST API using Marshmellow.
